abstract = {A novel method is presented for the design of heat exchanger networks. The method is the first to combine sufficient simplicity to be used by hand with near certainty to identify "best" designs, even for large problems. "Best" designs feature the highest degree of energy recovery possible with a given number of capital items. Moreover, they feature network patterns required for good controllability, plant layout, intrinsic safety, etc. ?? 1983.},
