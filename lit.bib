abstract = {This paper developed extensions to the existing research so that reliability assessment based on degradation modeling can address new problem domains that previously did not meet the required assumptions and modeling constraints. Degradation modeling is based on probabilistic modeling of a failure mechanism degradation path and comparison of a projected distribution to a pre-defined failure threshold. Previous approaches to this problem required that the predefined failure threshold must be considered as a fixed deterministic value, which can be problematic for several reasons. Often, the designer and producer of a part or a system have many diverse users of their products. In practice, the critical threshold value can vary appreciably among users. In this case, a probabilistic, rather than a deterministic threshold value is more appropriate. For other applications, the designer may not know with certainty what explicit level of degradation will cause a failure. In this case, specification of a range of possible threshold values is more appropriate. This also can be accommodated by considering the threshold value as a random variable with some assumed distribution to reflect the variability. New modeling approaches are presented in this paper such that this limiting assumption is no longer required. This should allow systems with more varied usage conditions and failure mechanisms to be analyzed using degradation-based reliability assessment methods.},

abstract = {A novel data-driven approach for optimization under uncertainty based on multistage adaptive robust optimization (ARO) and nonparametric kernel density M-estimation is proposed. Different from conventional robust optimization methods, the proposed framework incorporates distributional information to avoid over-conservatism. Robust kernel density estimation with Hampel loss function is employed to extract probability distributions from uncertainty data via a kernelized iteratively reweighted least squares algorithm. A data-driven uncertainty set is proposed, where bounds ofuncertain parameters are defined by quantile functions, to organically integrate the multistage ARO framework with uncertainty data. Based on this uncertainty set, we further develop an exact robust counterpart in its general form for solving the resulting data-driven multistage ARO problem. To illustrate the appli- cability ofthe proposed framework, two typical applications in process operations are presented: The first one is on strategic plan- ning of process networks, and the other one on short-term scheduling of multipurpose batch processes. The proposed approach returns 23.9{\%} higher net present value and 31.5{\%} more profits than the conventional robust optimization method in planning and scheduling applications, respectively.},

abstract = {A general optimization framework for the simultaneous operational planning of utility and production systems is presented with the main purpose of reducing the energy needs and material resources utilization of the overall system. The proposed mathematical model focuses mainly on the utility system and considers for the utility units: (i) unit commitment constraints, (ii) performance degradation and recovery, (iii) different types of cleaning tasks (online or offline, and fixed or flexible time-window), (iv) alternative options for cleaning tasks in terms of associated durations, cleaning resources requirements and costs, and (v) constrained availability of resources for cleaning operations. The optimization function includes the operating costs for utility and production systems, cleaning costs for utility systems, and energy consumption costs. Several case studies are presented in order to highlight the applicability and the significant benefits of the proposed approach. In particular, in comparison with the traditional sequential planning approach for production and utility systems, the proposed integrated approach can achieve considerable reductions in startup/shutdown and cleaning costs, and most importantly in utilities purchases, as it is shown in one of the case studies.},

abstract = {Dynamic time-varying operational conditions pose great challenge to the estimation of system remaining useful life (RUL) for the deteriorating systems. This paper presents a method based on probabilistic and stochastic approaches to estimate system RUL for periodically monitored degradation processes with dynamic time-varying operational conditions and condition-specific failure zones. The method assumes that the degradation rate is influenced by specific operational condition and moreover, the transition between different operational conditions plays the most important role in affecting the degradation process. These operational conditions are assumed to evolve as a discrete-time Markov chain (DTMC). The failure thresholds are also determined by specific operational conditions and described as different failure zones. The 2008 PHM Conference Challenge Data is utilized to illustrate our method, which contains mass sensory signals related to the degradation process of a commercial turbofan engine. The RUL estimation method using the sensor measurements of a single sensor was first developed, and then multiple vital sensors were selected through a particular optimization procedure in order to increase the prediction accuracy. The effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method are presented in a comparison with existing methods for the same dataset.},

In Part I of this work, new a priori and a posteriori probabilistic bounds were developed for cases when robust optimization is applied to uncertain optimization problems with parameters whose probability distributions were unknown. In Part II, the focus shifted to known probability distributions and a priori bounds. In this paper, new, tight a posteriori expressions are developed for constraints containing parameters with specific known distributions, that is, those attributed normal, uniform, discrete, gamma, chi-squared, Erlang, or exponential distributions. The nature of some of the expressions requires efficient implementations, and new algorithmic methods are discussed which greatly improve applicability. These new expressions are much tighter than existing bounds and greatly reduce the conservatism of robust solutions. The theoretical and algorithmic results of Parts I, II, and III allow for wider usage of robust optimization in process synthesis and operations research applications.},

In general, solving chance constrained optimization problems is challenging and the existing methods for solving a chance constrained optimization problem largely rely on solving an approximation problem. Among the various approximation methods, robust optimization can provide safe and tractable analytical approximation. In this paper, we address the question of what is the optimal (least conservative) robust optimization approximation for the chance constrained optimization problems. A novel algorithm is proposed to find the smallest possible uncertainty set size that leads to the optimal robust optimization approximation. The proposed method first identifies the maximum set size that leads to feasible robust optimization problems and then identifies the best set size that leads to the desired probability of constraint satisfaction. Effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated through a portfolio optimization problem, a production planning and a process scheduling problem.},

abstract = {A general framework for handling a wide range of scheduling problems arising in multiproduct/multipurpose batch chemical plants is presented. Batch processes involving a variety of complexities are represented using a state-task network. The novel feature of this representation is that both the individual batch operations ("tasks") and the feedstocks, intermediate and final products ("states") are included explicitly as network nodes. Processes involving sharing of raw materials and intermediates, batch splitting and mixing and recycles of material, can be represented unambiguously as such networks. The short-term scheduling problem is formulated as a mixed integer linear program (MILP) based on a discrete time representation. Flexible equipment allocation, variable batchsizes and mixed intermediate storage policies involving both dedicated and multipurpose storage vessels are taken into account. Limited availability of raw materials, both at the start and during the time horizon of interest, is accommodated. Product deliveries may take place at any time during the horizon, and the amounts involved may be either fixed or variable. The use of utilities by the various tasks may vary over the task processing time, and may be constant or proportional to the batchsize. The availability and/or cost of utilities may vary over the time horizon of interest. The objective function is the maximization of a profit function involving the value of the products, and the cost of raw materials, utilities and material storage. The formulation may result in MILPs involving large numbers of binary variables. Issues pertaining to the efficient solution of these problems are discussed in Part II of this paper. ?? 1993.},

The proposed approach ties industrial key-components such as asset management and production scheduling closer together and represents therefore a contribution to the smart manufacturing revolution.

abstract = {Remaining useful life (RUL) is the useful life left on an asset at a particular time of operation. Its estimation is central to condition based maintenance and prognostics and health management. RUL is typically random and unknown, and as such it must be estimated from available sources of information such as the information obtained in condition and health monitoring. The research on how to best estimate the RUL has gained popularity recently due to the rapid advances in condition and health monitoring techniques. However, due to its complicated relationship with observable health information, there is no such best approach which can be used universally to achieve the best estimate. As such this paper reviews the recent modeling developments for estimating the RUL. The review is centred on statistical data driven approaches which rely only on available past observed data and statistical models. The approaches are classified into two broad types of models, that is, models that rely on directly observed state information of the asset, and those do not. We systematically review the models and approaches reported in the literature and finally highlight future research challenges. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper presents a degradation modeling framework for computing condition-based residual life distributions of partially degraded systems and/or components functioning under time-varying environmental and/or operational conditions. Our approach is to mathematically model degradation-based signals from a population of components using stochastic models that combine three main sources of information: real-time degradation characteristics of component obtained by observing the component's in-situ degradation signal, the degradation characteristics of the component's population, and the real-time status of the environmental conditions under which the component is operating. Prior degradation information is used to estimate the model coefficients. The resulting generalized stochastic degradation model is then used to predict an initial residual life distribution for the component being monitored. In-situ degradation signals, along with real-time information related to the environmental conditions, are then used to update the residual life distributions in real-time. Because these updated distributions capture current health information and the latest environmental conditions, they provide precise lifetime estimates. The performance of the proposed models is evaluated using real world vibration-based degradation signals from a rotating machinery application.},

A parametric stochastic degradation modeling approach to estimate the Residual Life Distributions (RLDs) of systems/components that are operating in the field is presented. The proposed methodology rests on the idea of utilizing in situ degradations signals, communicated from fielded components, to update their respective RLDs in real time. Given the observed partial degradation signals, RLDs are evaluated based on a first-passage time approach. Expressions for the first-passage time for a base case linear degradation model, in which the degradation signal evolves as a Brownian motion, are derived.

For short-term scheduling, these constraints, along with sequencing issues, become even more critical, and part 2 explores the application of continuous time formulations to this class of problems. Two mixed-integer linear programming (MIP) formulations are presented for the detailed short-term scheduling of a single-stage multiproduct facility with multiple parallel semicontinuous processors. Given a set of due dates, demands for products at these dates, and several operational and topological constraints, it is desired to determine the start and end times of individual product campaigns and machine assignments to minimize the inventory, transition, and shortage costs. The key feature of these formulations is that they can accommodate prespecified discrete time events such as due dates while employing a continuous representation of time. In addition to regular production, various outages such as tests and maintenance can be scheduled and a variety of transitions between operations can be accommodated. For purposes of illustration, a (relatively) small real plant scheduling problem is solved},

The key features of the proposed model are the following: (a) a continuous-time representation is used, common for all units; (b) assignment constraints are expressed using binary variables that are defined only for tasks, not for units; (c) start times of tasks are eliminated, so that time-matching constraints are used only for the finish times of tasks; and (d) a new class of valid inequalities that improves the LP relaxation is added to the MILP formulation. Compared to other general continuous time STN formulations, the proposed model is faster. Compared to event-driven formulations, it is more general, as it accounts for resources other than equipment and gives solutions in comparable computational times.

abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of short-term cleaning scheduling in a special class of heat-exchanger networks (HENs). A salient characteristic of this problem is that the performance of each heat exchanger decreases with time and can then be restored to its initial state by performing cleaning operations. Because of its practical importance, a specific problem has been considered here involving decaying equipment performance due to milk fouling. A mixed-integer nonlinear-programming (MINLP) model is first presented incorporating general fouling profiles. This model is then linearized to a tight mixed-integer linear-programming (MILP) model which can be solved to global optimality. A detailed objective function is used to account for cleaning cost and energy requirements. The formulations can model serial and parallel HENs as well as network arrangements arising from the combination of these basic cases. The optimization algorithm determines simultaneously: (i) the number of cleaning operation tasks required along with their corresponding timings and (ii) the optimal utility utilization profile over time. A number of complex heat-exchanger networks examples are presented to illustrate the applicability of the proposed models together with comparative performance results between the MINLP and MILP models.},

abstract = {In many engineering optimization problems, the number of function evaluations is severely limited by time or cost. These problems pose a special challenge to the field of global optimization, since existing methods often require more function evaluations than can be comfortably afforded. One way to address this challenge is to fit response surfaces to data collected by evaluating the objective and constraint functions at a few points. These surfaces can then be used for visualization, tradeoff analysis, and optimization. In this paper, we introduce the reader to a response surface methodology that is especially good at modeling the nonlinear, multimodal functions that often occur in engineering. We then show how these approximating functions can be used to construct an efficient global optimization algorithm with a credible stopping rule. The key to using response surfaces for global optimization lies in balancing the need to exploit the approximating surface (by sampling where it is minimized) with the need to improve the approximation (by sampling where prediction error may be high). Striking this balance requires solving certain auxiliary problems which have previously been considered intractable, but we show how these computational obstacles can be overcome.},

We undertake a computational analysis of specific factors that contribute to the success of LBBD, to provide guidance for future implementations. We study a problem class that assign tasks to multiple resources and poses a cumulative scheduling problem on each resource. We find that LBBD is at least 1000 times faster than state-of-the-art MIP on larger instances, despite recent advances in the latter. Further, we conclude that LBBD is most effective when the planning and scheduling aspects of the problem are roughly balanced in difficulty. The most effective device for improving LBBD is the inclusion of a subproblem relaxation in the master problem. The strengthening of Benders cuts also plays an important role when the master and subproblem complexity are properly balanced. These findings suggest future research directions.},

We present an algorithm which uses both tech- niques in a two-step procedure. The first step employs Support Vector Machines within a One-vs-All reduction from multiclass to binary approach to obtain the dis- tances between each observation and the Support Vectors representing the classes. The second step uses these distances as inputs for a Neural Network, built with an entropy cost function and softmax transfer function for the output layer where class membership is used for training. Consequently, this network estimates prob- abilities of class membership for new observations. A benchmark using different databases demonstrates that the proposed algorithm is highly competitive with the most recent techniques for multiclass probability estimation.},

The performance of our model is evaluated based on degradation signals from both numerical experiments and a case study using real bearing data.

The repair effect is characterized by the change induced on the failure intensity before and after failure. In the first class of models, repair effect is expressed by a reduction of failure intensity. In the second class, repair effect is expressed by a reduction of the system virtual age. In each case, several particular cases are studied, which take into account the possibility of a markovian memory property. For almost every model studied, there exists a minimal wear intensity, i.e. a maximal lower bound for failure intensity. The classification presented here involves existing models and allows the proposition of new ones. The models are compared in terms of wear-out speed. Finally, a numerical statistical study on the quality of the model parameters estimators is presented. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

This paper presents a review of CBM literature with emphasis on mathematical modeling and optimization approaches. We focus this review on important aspects of the CBM, such as optimization criteria, inspection frequency, maintenance degree, solution methodology, etc. Since the modeling choice for the stochastic deterioration process greatly influences CBM strategy decisions, this review classifies the literature on CBM models based on the underlying deterioration processes, namely discrete- and continuous-state deterioration, and proportional hazard model. CBM models for multi-unit systems are also reviewed in this paper. This paper provides useful references for CBM management professionals and researchers working on CBM modeling and optimization.},

However, in recent years a wealth of new datasets has become available. Therefore, we take a more data-centric approach and propose a unified framework for studying climate, with an aim toward characterizing observed phenomena as well as discovering new knowledge in climate science. Specifically, we posit that complex networks are well suited for both descriptive analysis and predictive modeling tasks. We show that the structural properties of 'climate networks' have useful interpretation within the domain. Further, we extract clusters from these networks and demonstrate their predictive power as climate indices. Our experimental results establish that the network clusters are statistically significantly better predictors than clusters derived using a more traditional clustering approach. Using complex networks as data representation thus enables the unique opportunity for descriptive and predictive modeling to inform each other. 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

@article{Chevallier2017,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2017. The regime-switching L{\'{e}}vy model combines jump-diffusion under the form of a L{\'{e}}vy process, and Markov regime-switching where all parameters depend on the value of a continuous time Markov chain. We start by giving general stochastic results. Estimation is performed following a two-step procedure. The EM-algorithm is extended to this new class of jump-diffusion regime-switching models. Simulations are proposed, alongside an empirical application dedicated to the study of financial and commodity time series. When comparing the results with (i) non regime-switching models, and (ii) continuous regime-switching models (where the L{\'{e}}vy process is replaced by a classic Brownian motion), the L{\'{e}}vy regime-switching model outperforms other competitors.},

@book{Hart2017,
abstract = {This book provides a complete and comprehensive reference/guide to Pyomo (Python Optimization Modeling Objects) for both beginning and advanced modelers, including students at the undergraduate and graduate levels, academic researchers, and practitioners. The text illustrates the breadth of the modeling and analysis capabilities that are supported by the software and support of complex real-world applications. Pyomo is an open source software package for formulating and solving large-scale optimization and operations research problems. The text begins with a tutorial on simple linear and integer programming models. A detailed reference of Pyomo's modeling components is illustrated with extensive examples, including a discussion of how to load data from data sources like spreadsheets and databases. Chapters describing advanced modeling capabilities for nonlinear and stochastic optimization are also included. The Pyomo software provides familiar modeling features within Python, a powerful dynamic programming language that has a very clear, readable syntax and intuitive object orientation. Pyomo includes Python classes for defining sparse sets, parameters, and variables, which can be used to formulate algebraic expressions that define objectives and constraints. Moreover, Pyomo can be used from a command-line interface and within Python's interactive command environment, which makes it easy to create Pyomo models, apply a variety of optimizers, and examine solutions. The software supports a different modeling approach than commercial AML (Algebraic Modeling Languages) tools, and is designed for flexibility, extensibility, portability, and maintainability but also maintains the central ideas in modern AMLs.},
